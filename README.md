# Advent of Code 2022

These are my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). They are neither meticulously tested nor polished, they were just working well enough for the purpose of the event. Some provide only part of the answer, and a bit of manual labor was required for the solution. "a" is for part 1, "b" is for part 2, "c" is both combined.
